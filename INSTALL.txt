The code comes with a simple Django project and Heroku configuration that can be used 
to get a hosted version quickly up and running.  The configuration will be suitable
for demo purposes and for light internal usage.  

If you plan to use this heavily I recommend examining the configuration and making changes 
to suit your needs.

The Django project will provide:

* A Bootstrap-based base template, a login view, and a homepage
* All functionality locked down to logged-in users only
* All logged in users have full access to install and use the system
* Django Flat Pages are installed so you can add your own help pages, etc
* All site templates can be modified through the web using django-dbtemplates
* Through-the-web access to Django's Admin Site to manage users, templates, flat pages, and search/detail configuration

The core functionality is provided in two isolated Django apps called "actionkit_usersearch"
and "actionkit_userdetail".  These can be integrated into any larger Django project, if the 
provided Django project does not meet your needs.

Quick-Start on Heroku
=====================

You will need to create an account on Heroku and install the Heroku Toolbelt.  Then, from
a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git://github.com/350dotorg/aktivator.git
  cd aktivator
  heroku apps:create
  heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config.git
  heroku addons:add cleardb
  git push heroku master
  python standalone_django_project/required_environ.py .env
  heroku config:push
  heroku domains:add $(grep SITE_DOMAIN .env | tr '=' ' ' | cut -f2 -d' ')
  heroku config:set HEROKU_DOMAIN="$(git remote -v | grep heroku | cut -f2 -d':' | cut -f1 -d'.' | uniq).herokuapp.com"
  heroku run python manage.py syncdb
  heroku run python manage.py migrate
  heroku open

You will be prompted for input a few times during the installation -- for example
to provide database credentials to your Actionkit instance, and to create
a new Django superuser to log in to the site.  When this is done, a web browser
will open and prompt you to log in.  (You may need to configure your DNS for the site domain
you specified to point to the Heroku app, and then visit the app from that domain, 
in order to see it successfully.)

You should log in using the username and password for the Django superuser that you 
just created.

After logging in, visit /admin/actionkit/test_connection/ in the browser to confirm
that your Actionkit database and API connection are properly configured.

== Configuration ==

Through the Django Admin site you can configure the following behaviors:
 
 * /admin/actionkit_usersearch/userpermissions/ -- How many rows of
   data any given user account may export. (Default is all rows
   returned in a search, but for some user accounts you may want to
   limit the size of any given export to e.g. 100 rows.)
 
 * /admin/actionkit_usersearch/selectcolumn/ -- Extra "select" clauses
   that users may include in their exports.  Options include raw SQL
   subqueries, particular userfields, and several aggregate
   clauses. (Documentation and more options hopefully coming soon.)

 * /admin/actionkit_usersearch/whereclause/ -- Extra "where" clauses
   that users may filter their searches/exports by.  Options include
   the existence of a particular userfield or a particular value for a
   userfield.  (Documentation and more options hopefully coming soon.)

 * /admin/actionkit_userdetail/calloutuserfield/ -- Specific
   userfields that should be displayed in the top section of the user
   detail page, in addition to being printed in the "User Fields" tab
   at the bottom of that page.

== Debugging ==

If something goes wrong, you can run the following command in a terminal to view the
application's logs as you interact with the site:

.. code-block:: bash

  heroku logs -t

That might provide enough information to figure out the problem.  If not, you can 
switch the site into debug mode by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  heroku config:set DJANGO_DEBUG=1 DJANGO_DEBUG_TOOLBAR=1 INTERNAL_IPS=*

This will cause the site to display detailed debugging information in the browser
when any error occurs.  It will also cause the site to have a "debug mode" sidebar
that can be expanded on any page to view detailed SQL logs and other information.

When you're finished debugging, you should take the site out of debug mode by running:

{{{
heroku config:unset DJANGO_DEBUG DJANGO_DEBUG_TOOLBAR INTERNAL_IPS
}}}

Quick-Start for Local Development
=================================

To develop and run the system locally, or on your own server, looks
similar to running on Heroku.  Note that in addition to your primary
database (for which postgres is recommended) you will need an extra
MySQL database whose connection string is specified in the environment
under ACTIONKIT_DUMMY_DATABASE_URL.  This database does not need any 
tables; it is used under the hood to execute Django ORM queries to 
convert them into raw SQL for Actionkit.

Deficiencies
============

As mentioned above, this setup lacks several important components of a secure, 
maintainable production infrastructure.  For example:

* Static files are served locally from the Heroku environment instead of e.g. S3
* No system is set up to capture access and error logs (e.g. Papertrail) or monitor performance (e.g. New Relic)
* HTTPS is not configured

If you plan on leaving this web application running for a long time and using it
heavily, setting up your own installation instead of relying on this quick-start
guide is highly recommended.
